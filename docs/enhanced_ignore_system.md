# Enhanced Ignore Pattern System

## Overview

The enhanced ignore pattern system provides intelligent file filtering during code indexing by automatically detecting programming languages and frameworks, then applying community-maintained ignore patterns from GitHub's comprehensive gitignore templates.

## Features

### Automatic Language Detection
- Detects programming languages based on file extensions
- Identifies frameworks from project configuration files
- Zero manual configuration required

### GitHub Gitignore Integration
- Downloads and caches GitHub gitignore templates for 300+ languages
- Automatically applies appropriate ignore patterns based on detected languages
- Maintains templates up-to-date with community contributions

### Multi-Layer Ignore Management
1. **Community Templates**: GitHub-standard ignore patterns
2. **Project Conventions**: Existing `.gitignore` files
3. **Global Preferences**: User-defined global patterns
4. **Adaptive Learning**: Future enhancement for learned patterns

### Smart Pattern Matching
- Normalizes and compiles ignore patterns from multiple sources
- Efficient file matching with pattern optimization
- Directory-aware pattern evaluation

## Implementation Details

### Fast Language Detector
- Uses file extension analysis for rapid language identification
- Scans project files for framework indicator files
- Lightweight implementation suitable for real-time scanning

### Gitignore Template Manager
- Downloads templates from `github/gitignore` repository
- Caches templates locally for offline access
- Handles template updates and version management

### Smart Ignore Manager
- Combines ignore patterns from all configured sources
- Resolves pattern conflicts with defined precedence rules
- Provides efficient file matching interface

## Usage

The enhanced ignore pattern system is automatically enabled and requires no configuration. Simply run the indexing command:

```bash
code-index index
```

The system will automatically:
1. Detect languages and frameworks in your workspace
2. Download appropriate GitHub gitignore templates
3. Combine with existing `.gitignore` files
4. Apply comprehensive ignore patterns during indexing

## Future Enhancements

### Machine Learning Integration
- Content-based language detection with `guesslang`
- Adaptive learning from indexing results
- Smart pattern suggestion based on project type

### Advanced Pattern Management
- `.codeignore` file support for project-specific configuration
- CLI-driven ignore pattern management
- Pattern conflict resolution and precedence management

### Performance Optimizations
- Parallel pattern matching for large projects
- Incremental ignore pattern evaluation
- Caching of pattern matching results
